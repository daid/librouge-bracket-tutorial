# Hello

This repo implements the https://bfnightly.bracketproductions.com/rustbook/ tutorial chapters. But then in C++ based on [librouge](https://github.com/daid/librouge), and OOP instead of ECS.

# Why C++?

Because I can, and I want.

# Why OOP instead of ECS?

Because to show that it is also an option. ECS works great, but I find OOP quicker to build small scale stuff. If you are going for a high complexity roguelike, you are better off with ECS, and use entt for example.


I might do these in ECS as well as OOP at some point, just to show the differences.
